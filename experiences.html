                I have experience at American Express as a Salesforce Marketing Cloud Developer and Java Software Engineer Intern, where I worked on a variety of projects. I integrated Spring Boot APIs with Salesforce Marketing Cloud to streamline data processes and enhance customer engagement through personalized email templates. My role also involved designing and developing customer journeys, conducting unit testing, and deploying high-impact endpoints for risk decision workflows. Previously, I implemented a patch endpoint for modifying existing records and demonstrated proficiency with tools and technologies including Java 8/11, Spring/Spring Boot, Docker, Git, Unix, Gradle, MongoDB, CRUD operations, Postman, OOP, HTTP protocols, JUnit, and Mockito. Additionally, I worked as a College Aide at the NYC Department of Sanitation, where I supported administrative tasks and automated data input to help analyze project impacts and contribute to sustainability goals, using SQL.</p>
